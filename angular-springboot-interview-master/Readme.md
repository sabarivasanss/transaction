# Angular and Spring Boot Transaction Management UI Assignment

## Overview

Your task is to develop a simple Angular user interface for a Transaction Management system. The backend provides an API for accessing and managing financial transactions, but currently lacks the ability to fetch a transaction by ID and to save new transactions.

## Tasks

The assignment consists of three main tasks:

### Task 1: Display a List of Transactions - Create Simple Angular App

Create a component that calls the backend service to retrieve all transactions and displays them in a simple table format. Each row in the table should display the details of a transaction.

### Task 2: Implement Get Transaction by ID - Update Spring Boot App

The backend API does not currently support retrieving a transaction by its ID. Your task is to create a placeholder service method and a UI component that simulates the retrieval of a transaction by its ID.

Use a form to capture the transaction ID from the user, and display a mock transaction detail. The details should include all properties of a transaction like amount, currency, status, etc.

### Task 3: Implement Save Transaction - Update Spring Boot App

The backend API does not currently support saving a new transaction. Your task is to create a placeholder service method and a UI component that simulates saving a new transaction.

Create a form that accepts the necessary fields required to create a transaction, such as the transaction type, status, currency, and amount. Upon submission, display a message to the user that the transaction was saved successfully.

## Requirements

- Use Angular's latest stable release for the implementation.
- The UI should be simple and functional, no need for advanced styling or fancy graphics.
- Code should be clean, well-organized, and documented.
- Ensure proper error handling and form validations where applicable.

## Deliverables

- The source code of the Angular application.
- Push it to your github account and write down steps to run it.
- Instructions on how to run and test the application.(Optional)
- A brief explanation of your design decisions and any assumptions you made during the development. (Optional)


## Stretch Goals (Optional)

If you finish the main tasks early, consider working on the following enhancements:

- Implement UI for Adding New Transactions 
- Implement UI to search transaction by ID
- Write unit tests for your components and services.

Good luck with your assignment!
